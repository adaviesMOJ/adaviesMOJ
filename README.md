ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Aaron Davies!
I'm a Senior Software Developer specializing in Kotlin and Spring Boot development, currently working within the UK Government. I have a passion for building scalable, secure, and reliable backend services. 
I'm also expanding my skill set to include frontend development to become a more versatile full-stack developer.

ðŸš€ Technologies I Work With
Backend:
Kotlin - My go-to language for backend development.
Spring Boot - Building powerful microservices and enterprise-grade applications.
PostgreSQL - Efficient relational databases and complex queries.
Flyway - Database migrations for smooth deployments.
DevOps:
Docker / Docker Compose - Containerized applications and integration testing.
CircleCI - Automating builds, testing, and deployments.
Learning:
Frontend Technologies - Currently diving into React and Vue.js to complement my backend knowledge.
TypeScript & JavaScript - For more robust client-side development.
